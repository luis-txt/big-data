**Algorithms and Techniques for Efficient Big Data Processing**

This repository contains implementations of fundamental algorithms and techniques for handling large-scale data efficiently. These methods are widely applicable in scenarios involving data streams, sampling, and summary statistics.

## Features
- **Misra-Gries Algorithm**: An efficient algorithm for finding frequent elements in a data stream.
- **Alon-Matias-Szegedy (AMS) Algorithm**: Used for estimating the second moment of a data stream.
- **Bernoulli Sampling**: A probabilistic method for selecting a random sample from a data stream.
- **Reservoir Sampling**: A technique for maintaining a representative sample of a data stream of unknown size.
- **Big Data Mean and Variance**: Variations for calculating mean and variance in real-time for massive datasets.
